Hypothetical Statement – 1 (Revenue by Country)
1) Hypothesis Statement

Business Question:
Do customers from the United Kingdom generate a different transaction monetary value compared to Germany?

Null Hypothesis (H0)

There is no significant difference in transaction monetary value between United Kingdom and Germany.

Alternate Hypothesis (H1)

There is a significant difference in transaction monetary value between United Kingdom and Germany.

2) Statistical Test (What we’ll use)

 Mann–Whitney U Test (Non-parametric test)
Because transaction monetary values are highly skewed (not normally distributed) and contain outliers.

Hypothesis Statement – 1 (Final Conclusion Text)
Which statistical test have you done to obtain P-Value?

I performed the Mann–Whitney U Test to compare transaction monetary values between United Kingdom and Germany.

Why did you choose the specific statistical test?

This test was chosen because transaction totals are highly skewed with extreme outliers, making a non-parametric test more reliable than a normality-based t-test.

Final Conclusion
Since the p-value = 2.35e-09 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and
conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in transaction monetary values between UK and Germany.

Statistical Test Used

 Mann–Whitney U Test (Two-sided)

Why this Statistical Test?

Transaction monetary values are typically right-skewed, contain outliers, and violate normality assumptions.
The Mann–Whitney U test is a non-parametric method that robustly detects differences between two independent groups without requiring normal distribution.

Result Interpretation (using your output)

Since p-value = 2.35 × 10⁻⁹ < 0.05, we reject H0 and conclude that UK and Germany have statistically 
different transaction spending distributions.

Business Impact (What this proves)

This result supports implementing market-specific strategies, such as differentiated promotion 
intensity, localized pricing approaches, and inventory planning based on geographic purchasing behavior.
