1) Model Comparison: Silhouette Score (Higher is Better)
This chart shows that DBSCAN has the highest silhouette, meaning it forms the most “mathematically separated” clusters among the three.
However, silhouette alone can be misleading when clusters are heavily imbalanced, which DBSCAN often produces on dense RFM data.
From a business view, KMeans and Agglomerative provide more usable multi-segment groups, even if DBSCAN’s score looks better.

2) Model Comparison: Davies–Bouldin Index (Lower is Better)
DBSCAN shows the lowest Davies–Bouldin Index, meaning its clusters are very compact and well-separated under its density rules.
But the business trade-off is that DBSCAN achieves this by isolating only a few groups and pushing many customers into one dominant cluster.
For real-world campaigns, we prefer a model that supports clear segmentation strategy, not just “perfect separation”.

3) Cluster Size Comparison (Customers per Cluster)
This graph highlights a key operational factor: KMeans distributes customers more meaningfully across multiple clusters, while DBSCAN is dominated by one cluster.
Agglomerative shows segmentation but still creates uneven clusters, suggesting overlap in customer behavior patterns.
From a marketing execution perspective, KMeans gives the best balance for targeted campaigns, retention strategy, and budget allocation.

4) Frequency vs Monetary (All 3 Models Side-by-Side)
Across all models, a small number of customers show high frequency and high monetary value, representing your premium buyer segment.
KMeans separates this high-value group more consistently, making it easier to define “VIP vs Regular vs Occasional” actions.
For business impact, this directly supports cross-selling, loyalty campaigns, and boosting average order value (AOV).

5) Recency vs Monetary (All 3 Models Side-by-Side)
This visual clearly shows that customers with low recency (recent buyers) can vary greatly in spending, meaning not all active customers are high-value.
KMeans creates clearer separation by capturing both “recent activity” and “high spending” as different behavioral groups.
Business-wise, this enables retention prioritization, where high spend + recent buyers get premium benefits and high recency buyers get win-back offers.

6) KMeans Cluster Centroids (Original Scale)
This centroid plot summarizes each segment’s average behavior and reveals a strong “VIP” cluster with extremely high monetary value.
It confirms the segmentation is meaningful because clusters represent distinct customer types, not random splits.
In business terms, centroids act like segment personas that guide personalized discounts, loyalty tiers, and pricing strategy.

7) Cluster Behavior Heatmap (RFM Means)
The heatmap makes it easy to compare how each model forms clusters in terms of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary averages.
It shows KMeans has a clean high-value cluster pattern, while Agglomerative and DBSCAN create clusters that can be harder to interpret at scale.
This supports selecting KMeans for deployment because its segments are more explainable, stable, and actionable for decision-making.

8) Correlation Matrix (Recency vs Frequency vs Monetary)
Frequency and Monetary show a moderate positive correlation (~0.55), meaning repeat customers generally contribute higher revenue.
Recency has a negative correlation with Frequency and Monetary, suggesting customers who haven’t purchased recently tend to spend less and buy less often.
This directly supports business initiatives like early churn detection, win-back campaigns, and customer lifetime value (CLV) growth strategies.
