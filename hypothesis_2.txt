Hypothetical Statement – 2 (Customer Segments Spend Differently)
Research Objective

To verify whether the customer segments produced by KMeans RFM clustering show statistically significant differences in Monetary value, validating that the clustering is meaningful and business-actionable.

Null Hypothesis (H0)

The average Monetary value is the same across all customer clusters (no significant difference between segments).

Alternate Hypothesis (H1)

At least one cluster’s Monetary value differs significantly, meaning customer segments represent different spending behaviors.

Statistical Test We Will Use 

 Kruskal–Wallis H Test (Non-parametric ANOVA alternative)
Because Monetary is skewed, has outliers, and clusters are independent.

Hypothesis Statement – 2 
Which statistical test have you done to obtain P-Value?

I performed the Kruskal–Wallis H Test to compare Monetary spending distributions across multiple customer clusters generated from RFM-based KMeans segmentation.

Why did you choose the specific statistical test?

Monetary spending is highly skewed and outlier-driven, and we are comparing more than two independent clusters, so Kruskal–Wallis is the most reliable non-parametric alternative to ANOVA.

Final Conclusion

Since the p-value = 5.50e-248 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that customer segments show statistically significant differences in spending, validating that the clustering is meaningful and business-actionable.
